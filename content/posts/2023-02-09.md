# Earth rise

In December 1968, three astronauts were orbiting the moon when they saw something amazing -- the earth rising above the moon's horizon. They snapped some shots, one of which became the iconic [Earthrise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE-vOscpiNc). Later that day (though it's a bit hard to define what *day* means when you're orbiting the moon), the astronauts broadcast a message to *the largest audience that had ever listened to a human voice*. NASA had told them to *do something appropriate*, and they decided to read from [the first chapter of Genesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToHhQUhdyBY).

# The beginning of the Bible

Here is the beginning of the Bible, [Genesis chapter one](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?del=all&add=KJV&add=WLC&add=NASB&add=LXX):

> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
	
> And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
	
> Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.
	
> God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
	
> God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening and there was morning, one day.

> Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
	
> God made the expanse, and separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse; and it was so.
	
> God called the expanse “heaven.” And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.

> Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.
	
> And God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of the waters He called “seas”; and God saw that it was good.
	
> Then God said, “Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit according to their kind with seed in them”; and it was so.
	
> The earth produced vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, according to their kind; and God saw that it was good.
	
> And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.

> Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and they shall serve as signs and for seasons, and for days and years;
	
> and they shall serve as lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so.
	
> God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also.
	
> God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,
	
> and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
	
> And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

> Then God said, “Let the waters teem with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.”
	
> And God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.
	
> God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
	
> And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

	
> Then God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kind: livestock and crawling things and animals of the earth according to their kind”; and it was so.
	
> God made the animals of the earth according to their kind, and the livestock according to their kind, and everything that crawls on the ground according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.

> Then God said, “Let Us make mankind in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every crawling thing that crawls on the earth.”
	
> So God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
	
> God blessed them; and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
	
> Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you;
	
> and to every animal of the earth and to every bird of the sky and to everything that moves on the earth which has life, I have given every green plant for food”; and it was so.
	
> And God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day. 

# Questions

This text raises many questions. For example, given today's science, it has to be wrong doesn't it? It says the earth was made in six days but we know it took thousands of millions of years. (Our sun is a second generation star. First there was the big bang, then the first generation of stars which produced everything in the periodic table besides primordial hydrogen or helium, then the formation of our solar system from the remnants of first generation stars. All this took about nine thousand million years.) Isn't it wrong for the earth to be formed before the sun and moon appear? And who wrote it down, given that there were no humans when most of it happened?

# Who wrote it down?

Who do you think wrote this down? Does Genesis give us any clues? How did they find out?

# What does the text actually say?

This is a favorite saying of my New Testament teacher, Dr Richard K. Moore. To understand what a text actually says we need to understand the context. We need to get into the minds of the first readers of this account and we have to know what other accounts were around. Just as today we have a common understanding of how the earth came to be, so did they. Ours is a scientific understanding but theirs is religious.

It turns out that back then there were a number of accounts of how the world came to be. Each major civilization of the ancient near east had its own account involving its own gods. One example is the Babylonian epic, the *Enuma Elish*, which has a number of common elements with the Genesis account, but also significant differences. According to the Wikipedia article on the [Enuma Elish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En%C5%ABma_Eli%C5%A1),

> Overarching similarities include: reference to a watery chaos before creation; a separation of the chaos into heaven and earth; different types of waters and their separation; as well as the numerical similarity between the seven tablets of the epic and the seven days of creation. However, another analysis (Heidel 1951) notes many differences, including polytheism vs. monotheism, and personification of forces and qualities in the Babylonian myth vs. imperative creation by God in the biblical stories; permanence of matter vs. creation out of nothing; and the lack of any real parallel for Marduk's long battles with monsters. He also notes some broad commonalities of both texts with other religions, such as a watery chaos found in Egyptian, Phoenician, and Vedic works; and that both texts were written in languages with a common Semitic root. Regarding the creation of man, there are similarities in the use of dust or clay, but man's purpose is inverted in the two texts: in the Enūma Eliš man is created as a servant of gods, whereas in Genesis man is given more agency. Nevertheless in both, the dust is infused with "godhood", either through a god's blood in the Enūma Eliš, or by being made in God's image in Genesis. As to the seven tablets and seven days of each system, the numbered itineraries in general do not closely match, but there are some commonalities in order of the creation events: first darkness, then light, the firmament, dry land, and finally man, followed by a period of rest.

Common elements of the [Egyptian creation stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_creation_myths#Common_elements) also have points of contact with the Genesis account:

> The different myths have some elements in common. They all held that the world had arisen out of the lifeless waters of chaos, called Nu. They also included a pyramid-shaped mound, called the benben, which was the first thing to emerge from the waters.
