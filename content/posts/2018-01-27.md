# Introduction

We've been going through Paul's Letter to the Philippians and today we are up to chapter three. Paul wrote this letter from prison, and he seems to have doubts about getting out alive: *To me life means Christ and death means gain* [Phil 1.21](https://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Philippians+1%3A21#cv).

Some think he was in prison in Rome, others in Ephesus, and others in Caesarea. I think the Letter fits well with his imprisonment in Caesarea after being arrested in the temple at Jerusalem. You can read about the surrounding events in Acts chapters 21 to 26. The religious establishment in Israel, who the New Testament calls *The Jews*, was after Paul and wanted him dead. (The establishment *Jews* of the New Testament should not be confused with the Jews of today -- when you hear *Jews* in the New Testament, think of a powerful religious establishment that regards Christianity as a heresy.) Paul used to be one of the religious establishment until something strange happened to him on the road to Damascus. (See [Acts 9.3-9](https://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Acts+9%3A3#cv).)

# Finally

What we now call *Phillipians chapter three* is just part a letter Paul wrote to his friends in a city called Phillipi. He says, *Finally, brothers, rejoice in the Lord.*

When I hear *finally* in a sermon I am always glad because it means the preacher is about to finish. But, as is typical with Paul, he has a lot to say. He proceeds to write as much as he has already written. His *finally* means he is only half finished! The context, reading what has gone before, is that Epaphroditus had come all the way from Phillipi (a six week trip if Paul is in Caesarea) to bring some help from the people there. (Lydia, the first European to believe the Good News, was one of them.) This help might have been food, money, clothes, or just someone to keep Paul company. As it turns out, Epaphroditus got sick and nearly died. So Paul's *rejoice in the Lord* is in the context of someone coming close to death in Christ's service.

# Dogs and slashers

Now Paul lets rip. He says something like *I've told you before and I'll tell you again -- watch out for those dogs. Watch out for the slashers!* At this point we begin to blush because he is talking about circumcision, and the people who make circumcision a condition of entry into God's household. This seems very strange to us today, but at that time it made perfect sense. The Jewish religious establishment insisted that to become one of God's people it was necessary to be circumcised. In those days they would pray like this: *Thank you God that I was not born a dog or a woman.* A *dog* was a pagan -- someone they regarded as cursed for worshipping the wrong God or worshipping the wrong way or not bothering with God at all. Well, Paul turns the tables and calls the religious establishment *dogs*.

Paul says, *We are the real circumcision, we who worship through God's Spirit, we whose glory comes from the Jesus the Messiah, without trusting in the flesh.* Elsewhere ([Col 2.11](https://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Colossians+2%3A11#cv)) Paul talks about a true circumcision -- one in which Christ himself is the priest who separates a Christian from the *flesh*, that which works against the things of God. He is talking about being right with God by trusting in what Christ does, not some crude physical operation.

# Paul is well qualified

When Paul talks about trusting in the flesh he is not just talking about the physical operation but the whole religious system that goes with it. If we want a contemporary example, *trusting in the flesh* is trusting any human religious system to make God happy with us. Take your pick: anything with *-ism* written after it will do, anything that says we can get where we need to go by following a set of man made rules. That is trusting in the flesh.

Getting back to the *dogs* and *slashers*, Paul now says that according to their rules he has unbeatable qualifications:

* born of the race of Israel (i.e. descended from Jacob)
* of the tribe of Benjamin
* a pure Hebrew (both parents Hebrew)
* circumcised when eight days old (as the Law requires)
* a Pharisee (i.e. a strictly observant Jew)
* faultless with respect to the Law (no one could show he had broken a commandment)
* zealous to the point of rounding up followers of the Way of Christ.

Paul is one of them! He is an insider. But he knows something, and this is at the heart of the message he proclaims wherever he goes. **The Law is useless when it comes to being right with God.**

How does he know? Because something strange happened to him on the road to Damascus. He was going there to round up Christians, followers of the Way of Christ. He had letters authorizing him to do so signed by the religious authorities of Jerusalem. He was getting close to Damascus when a blinding light flashed and a voice said to him *Why are you persecuting me?* Paul, probably in shock, says *Who are you Lord?* (By saying *Lord*, he acknowledges that the One speaking is his (new) master.) Then Paul hears the words that turned his world upside down. *I am Jesus, and you are persecuting me.* All that Paul trusted in, all that he understood, everything that made him someone, all that he was proud of, turned out to be wrong, utterly wrong. What he thought were advantages were actually disadvantages. This is how Paul puts it:

> Yet all such advantages I have reckoned as loss because of Christ. More than that, I reckon everything as loss because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord far outweighs everything else. It was for his sake that I let everything go; I count it all as worthless rubbish if only I can have Christ as my reward and be found one with him. I want to be found, not as one who has some legal form of righteousness of his own, but as one who believes in Christ and whom God, for that very reason, has made right with himself. All I want is to know Christ and the power which comes through his resurrection. I want to share his sufferings and become like him in his death; and, if I dare hope it, I want to be raised again from death. [Phil 3.7-11, Translator's New Testment](https://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Philippians+3%3A7#cv)

Paul regards all of his former adavantages as *worthless rubbish*. The Greek word is σκυβαλα, which means *refuse, rubbish, dirt, dung* [@gingrich1965]. This is the stuff you throw to the street dogs. It is stinky and disgusting according to Paul's new way of seeing things.
