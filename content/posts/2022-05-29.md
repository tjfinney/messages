## Lord Most High

Verse seven of Psalm 97 says:

    For You are the Lord Most High over all the earth;
    You are exalted far above all gods.

Many agree that there is one God, though not everyone. There are places around the world today where people think that there are many gods -- one for this and one for that. If something goes wrong here then you have to pray to that god over there, if you want to find out about such and such then you have to go and consult the god who lives at so and so. It's complicated. This is the kind of world view that prevailed at a place called Philippi in what we now call Greece when Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke arrived there.

## Mission 101

As Christians we are meant to be involved in mission. However, we live in challenging times when people don't seem to be very interested in the Christian message. Perhaps we can learn something about spreading the Good News of Jesus Christ by looking at how Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke ended up in Philippi, and what happened when they got there.

Back in chapter 15 of Acts it says:

> After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, 'Let's return and visit the believers in every town where we proclaimed the Lord's message to see how they are getting on.' Barnabas was wanting to take along John (who goes by the name of Mark) as well. Paul, however, didn't consider it appropriate to take along a person who'd left them in the lurch in Pamphylia and hadn't accompanied them on their assignment. So sharp was the difference of opinion that they separated from one another: Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, while Paul chose Silas, and, after being entrusted to the Lord's grace by the believers, went on his way. He travelled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the congregations.

[Acts 15.36-41, *Under the Southern Cross: The New Testament in Australian English*, trans. Richard K. Moore (USC)]

The first thing we notice is that the mission started with Paul saying, "Let's see how they are getting on." Barnabas and Paul had already been on a long trip into Asia Minor (modern day Turkey) to spread the Gospel. Earlier on some people had started spreading the message of Jesus to non-Jewish people living in a city called Antioch in the Roman Province of Syria. (Another word for non-Jewish people is *Gentiles*.) The apostles in Jerusalem heard about this and sent a man named Barnabas to investigate. He is described as "a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith." Even his name says something about him: Barnabas means *son of encouragement*.

When Barnabas got to Antioch he was very happy to see the kindness that God was extending to the non-Jewish believers. He encouraged everyone involved to keep up the good work. Antioch is the first place where people who followed the way of Jesus were called *Christians*. Instead of going straight back to Jerusalem, Barnabas kept going to a place called Tarsus to search for Paul. (Tarsus was Paul's home town.) [Acts 11.19-26]

Presumably Barnabas thought it would be a good idea to get Paul involved in the work at Antioch. Maybe Barnabas knew how Jesus appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus, giving instructions "to carry my name before non-Jews, as well as kings and the people of Israel." There are other factors that would make Paul a good choice: he grew up in [Tarsus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus%2C_Mersin#Roman_period), where you could get a good Greek education; alsso, he had studied in Jerusalem, learning at the feet of the famous Jewish teacher named [Gamaliel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel). Paul had one foot in the Greek world and another foot in the Jewish world.

Before going on it might be a good idea to show you a map of the eastern Mediterranean showing the places they went:

After finding him they went back there. 


and wanted to see how the groups of people met I suppose the first one is: *sometimes there are arguments but that doesn't mean our work has to stop.* Another one is: *let's entrust ourselves to the Lord's grace -- that is, let's entrust ourselves to his kindness and goodwill.*



Psalm 97 foreshadows the messianic era when God will reign supreme over the earth. Its verses reference God's sovereignty, his enactment of justice, and the widespread rejoicing that will ensue.[8][9]
Verse 8

    Zion hears and is glad,
    And the daughters of Judah rejoice.[10]

Zion is Jerusalem; the "daughters of Judah" are the other towns in Judah.[11]
Uses
Judaism

Psalm 97 is the third of six psalms recited during the Kabbalat Shabbat (Welcoming the Shabbat) service.[12] These six psalms represent the six days of the week, with Psalm 97 corresponding to the third day (Tuesday).[8]

Verse 11 of the psalm, "Light is sown for the righteous...", is recited by Ashkenazi Jews at the start of the Kol Nidre service on Yom Kippur.[8][13]

Verse 11 is also one of the verses which the Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law) advises a person to say if he is having trouble falling asleep.[14]
New Testament

In the Letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament, Hebrews 1:5–13 relates a number of scriptural proofs that "the Son is greater than the angels",[15] including at verse 6, And let all the angels of God worship him.[16] The Masoretic text version of Psalm 97:7 reads worship him, all ye gods but the Septuagint equivalent reads "προσκυνήσατε αὐτῷ πάντες οἱ ἄγγελοι αὐτοῦ", worship him, all ye his angels. Biblical commentator A. F. Kirkpatrick suggests that the Hebrews quotation may have come from Psalm 97:7 or alternatively from the Septuagint expansion of Deuteronomy 32:43.[17]
