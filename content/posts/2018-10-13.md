# Telling God's story

Christians are meant to be evangelists. That means we are meant to tell people the good news. The word *evangelist* comes from the Greek ευαγγελιον, which means *good news*. The word *gospel* also means *good news* but has German ancestry (as do a lot of English words).^[The [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gospel) dictionary says, "Middle English, from Old English gōdspel (translation of Late Latin evangelium), from *gōd* good + *spell* tale".]

If you are like me then you have trouble being an evangelist. I find evangelism hard, like going to the dentist. I know I should do it but I don't want to. I'd rather not go and suffer for fear of what will happen if I do go.

Tonight we will hear about a surprising evangelist and perhaps learn from her how to be a happy gospeller.

# Going through Samaria

This story starts with Jesus being in unfriendly territory. He had been near the Jordan River but decided he had better get out of there and go back to where he lived, which was a long way off in Galilee. The reason he had to go is that a  religious group called the Pharisees found out he was baptizing more people than John the Baptist. The Pharisees were already mad at John the Baptist but now here was Jesus getting even more followers. In fact Jesus wasn't baptizing anyone. His followers, who we call *disciples*, were the ones doing the baptizing. Some of Jesus' followers were originally followers of John the Baptist, so they knew a thing or two about baptizing people as a symbol of repentance.

To get back home, Jesus had to walk through Samaria, which is where the Samaritans lived. Jesus is a Jew, a descendant of Abraham. For a Jew, the right place to worship is Jerusalem. Samaritans are also descendants of Abraham, but for them the right place to worship is not Jerusalem but a place called [Mount Gerizim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gerizim), a place where the [Samaritan religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritanism) is still practised to this day.

Back then, Jews and Samaritans did not get along. To know why they didn't get along we need to know a bit of history, which you can read about in [2 Kings 17.24-41](http://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=II+Kings+17%3A24#cv). Assyria invaded the northern part of Israel called Samaria and it fell in 721 BC. Until then its people practised the Jewish religion. The Assyrian king brought in people from five outside nations. A bit later those people started getting eaten by lions. The king of Assyria then thought he had bettee send in a Hebrew priest to teach them how to worship the God of Israel. However, those people kept their old gods too, which is breaking the first commandment God gave to Moses:

> You shall have no gods except me [Exodus 20.3](http://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Exodus+20%3A3#cv)

Given this history, a typical Jewish person looked on Samaritans as heretics (because they worshipped in the wrong place) and impostors (because they had questionable ancestry). It looks like some of Jesus' followers didn't like Samaritans either. In Luke's Gospel we are told about one time when James and John, two of Jesus' first followers, wanted God to burn a Samaritan village.^[See [Luke 9.51-56](http://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Luke+9%3A51#cv).]

# Give me a drink

Jesus is sitting down by a well when a Samaritan lady comes up. It is lunch time (midday), so it's hot. Jesus says, "Give me a drink."

Now, what's wrong with this picture? Give me some ideas.

Here are a few of the things that are wrong:

1. Jesus' followers aren't there.

2. Jesus talks to an unaccompanied woman.

3. Jesus talks to an unaccompanied Samaritan woman.

Well John tells us why the disciples aren't there -- they've gone into town to get lunch. But that doesn't explain why Jesus is talking to an unaccompanied woman. This would raise a few eyebrows. And it doesn't say why Jesus starts the conversation, and why he starts a conversation with a **Samaritan woman**. This would raise all of the eyebrows that are not already raised. It is just not done. Jesus is breaking a lot of basic rules that his followers would expect him to follow.

There is something else as well. She is getting water at lunch time. The right time to get water is *not* lunch time. Anyone who walks a long way to get water then carry it all the way back again knows that lunch time is the wrong time to get water.^[See e.g. [Gen 24.11](http://crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Genesis+24%3A11#cv).] One possible explanation for her going to get water at lunch time is that she was ostracized by her own people. So here she is, a woman, a Samaritan woman, a Samaritan woman whose own people reject her, and some Jewish guy tries to start up a conversation.

To be an evangelist I need to:

* have the story to tell

* have someone I want to tell

* have someone that wants to listen.
