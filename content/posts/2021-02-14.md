For Phoebe, who encouraged me to write this down.

And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.

[Deuteronomy 8.10](https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0508.htm#10)

For these and all thy mercies, Lord make us truly thankful.

Thank you for this food, and for the hands that prepared it. Thank you for the people who worked to give us this food. Thank you for the tractors they drove and the farms they ploughed. Thank you for the seeds they planted and the rain you sent to water them.

Thank you for making things right for the plants to grow. Thank you for the sun and the wind and the rain. Thank you that it wasn't too hot or too cold for things to grow.

Thank you for putting the Earth the right distance from the sun so that everything doesn't freeze or boil. Thank you for putting an atmosphere on the Earth so that we can breath and so our blood doesn't boil and so that we don't get fried by the electrons and protons coming out of the sun. Thank you for making the Earth's magnetic field so that the electrons and protons make a nice aurora instead of giving us a fatal radiation dose.

We should also thank you for making the radioactive decay which supplies the heat to keep the Earth's core molten so that it can generate that magnetic field we need to keep the atmosphere intact and stop the solar wind cooking us like this nice food we are about to eat.

Amen
