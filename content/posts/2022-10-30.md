## Hebrew Bible

[Isaiah 1.10-18 NASB](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Isaiah+1%3A10#cv)

> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah! What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats. When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? 

> Trample my courts no more; bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation-- I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity. Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them. When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.

> Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow. Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.

## Gospel

[Luke 19.1-10 NASB](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Luke+19%3A1#cv)

> He entered Jericho and was passing through it. A man was there named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. He was trying to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd he could not, because he was short in stature. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see him, because he was going to pass that way.

> When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today." So he hurried down and was happy to welcome him. All who saw it began to grumble and said, "He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner." Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, "Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much." Then Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost."

# Rulers of Sodom; people of Gomorrah

You know something is wrong when God calls you *rulers of Sodom* and *people of Gomorrah*. Sodom and Gomorrah were cities on a plain somewhere near where the Dead Sea is now. You may remember what happened straight after God told Abraham and Sarah that they would have a son in their old age:

[Gen 18.17-21 NASB](https://www.crosswire.org/study/parallelstudy.jsp?key=Genesis+18%3A17#cv)

>  The Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, since Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed? “For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, so that the Lord may bring upon Abraham what He has spoken about him.”
	
> And the Lord said, “The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. “I will go down now and see whether they have done entirely as the outcry, which has come to Me indicates; and if not, I will know.”

There are threads here that recur throughout the Bible:

* God chooses people
* God's people follow his way when they do what is right
* God hears the outcry
* God checks the facts.

God's way -- the right way -- is spelled out in Isaiah:

> cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow.

I suppose that is what Jesus meant when he said *Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.* Jesus calls people to change their way, to turn from darkness to light, to let the sun of righteousness rise upon them with healing in his wings.

This brings us to Zacchaeus of Jericho, whose story is a Sunday School favourite. Children know what it's like to miss out because the big people are in front. I hear that Michael Lush from Scripture Union climbed onto the church piano or anything else handy when telling this story. It's all about a short man who climbs a tree to see Jesus, isn't it? Maybe not. Let's take a closer look.

Luke tells us this about Zacchaeus:

> he was a chief tax collector and was rich

Zacchaeus is a success. He has made it. But he knows what it's like to be taunted. People probably made jokes about him and called him *shorty* or something like that. No doubt the people around Jericho didn't like him. He would have been ostracized because people thought he was bad, collaborating with the occupying forces to extract their wealth. Despite his wealth, not all was well in the House of Zacchaeus.
