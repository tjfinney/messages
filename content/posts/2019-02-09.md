Tonight we will look at something from Luke's Gospel, which tells us about what happened once when Jesus was invited to a meal. Here is how it starts:

> One of the Pharisees invited him to a meal. When he arrived at the Pharisee's house and took his place at table, a woman came in, who had a bad name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and had brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment. She waited behind him at his feet, weeping, and her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them away with her hair; then she covered his feet with kisses and anointed them with the ointment. [Luke 7.36-38, Jerusalem Bible]

The person who invited Jesus to dinner was a Pharisee. We find out later that his name is Simon. Being a Pharisee means that he is a religious man who is careful to live according to the Law of Moses, to follow all of God's commandments as found in the Hebrew Bible, what we call the Old Testament. There are a lot of rules to follow: not just the ten commandments but hundreds of others as well. The idea is that if you obey the commandments found in the Law of Moses then you are acceptable to God. This is the Old Testament, the Old Covenant. Many people, like Simon, live according to this understanding of how to have a good relationship with God.

The other person is the woman with a bad name. We don't know much about her except that she went to Simon's house when she heard that Jesus was going to be there. She took a jar of ointment with her and stood behind Jesus, at his feet. You might wonder how she could stand at his feet. Well, it's because they did things differently back then. We usually sit at a table to eat but they used to recline at a low table. You would lie on your side, resting on your elbow, with your feet away from the table. This was important because you did not want people's feet anywhere near your face when you were eating.

In those days people walked from place to place. They wore sandals and their feet got dusty. Hospitality was important, and an important part of hospitality was to let people wash their feet when they got to your house. If you had a servant then you would tell the servant to wash your guests' feet when they arrived for dinner. Other things you could do to make your guests feel at home was to kiss them when they arrived and to let them tidy themselves up with some oil for their hair. (This seems strange to us now, but that's how it was back then.)

Going back to the story, we have Simon, Jesus, and the woman with a bad name. She makes a scene, crying and putting ointment on Jesus' feet. To top it off, she wipes his feet with her hair and even kisses them! What a sight! Here is a person with a bad reputation doing some embarrassing things.

This is a place where it pays to look at the Greek. What is translated as *bad name* is ἁμαρτωλός, *sinner*. The jar of ointment is an alabaster container that contains myrrh. This would have been oil of myrrh, an extremely precious substance. It is an ingredient of the [anointing oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_anointing_oil) that is used for dedicating things to God. It was only allowed to be used for the things of God, for making a person a priest or a king. *Messiah* in Hebrew and *Christ* in Greek mean the same thing: *anointed one*.

Continuing with the Greek, the woman doesn't just cry but rains down tears on his feet. It's not one or two tears, it's a flood. And she doesn't just give his feet a peck, she kisses his feet earnestly. Even the word used for her carrying the alabaster bottle of myrrh has a sense of something precious, something recovered, something rescued from oblivion. (See [κομίσασα](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B1+&la=greek#lexicon).)

What would have made this woman act so improperly? Why did she abandon herself in such an extravagant way? Did something about Jesus' feet set her off? I think this is the key. Here is something from the Book of Isaiah:

```
Awake, awake!
Clothe yourself in your strength, Zion.
Put on your richest clothes, Jerusalem, holy city;
since the unclean shall no longer enter you.
Shake off your dust; get to your feet, captive Jerusalem!
Free your neck from its chains, captive daughter of Zion.
For the Lord says this:
You were sold for nothing and you will be redeemed without money.
...
How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news,
Who heralds peace, brings happiness, proclaims salvation
and tells Zion, “Your God is king!”

[Isaiah 52.1-7 JB (adapted)]
```

I think it was the feet of him who brings good news that brought her undone. It was the message that Jesus proclaimed that made her break down. It was the Gospel of peace, happiness, and salvation that made her weep uncontrollably. Maybe she had been sold for nothing, had been made to feel utterly worthless. Now she was being redeemed without money by the One who is happy to be her king.

Let's get back to Luke's Gospel. How did Simon react to all this?

> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, 'If this man were a prophet, he would know who this woman is that is touching him and what a bad name she has'. Then Jesus took him up and said, 'Simon, I have something to say to you'. 'Speak, Master' was the reply. 'There was once a creditor who had two men in his debt; one owed him five hundred denarii, the other fifty. They were unable to pay, so he pardoned them both. Which of them will love him more?' 'The one who was pardoned more, I suppose' answered Simon. Jesus said, 'You are right'. [Luke 7.39-43 JB]

This is where we find out that the host's name is Simon. He does not react in the same way as the woman. Instead, he thinks to himself that Jesus must be a fake. After all, if he was a prophet, surely he would know what kind of woman is touching him. I'm sad to say that I have more in common with Simon than the woman. That's exactly the kind of attitude I would have, and I would probably say the same thing to myself.

This is where things might have started to change for Simon, and where things can start to change for people like me who are more like Simon than the woman. Somehow Jesus knows what Simon is thinking, but Simon doesn't know that yet. It might have taken him a while to realise it. Anyway, Jesus says "Simon, I have something to say to you." Then he tells a little story, a parable about two people in debt. One owes the rich guy fifty day's wages and the other one owes him five hundred day's wages. (That's a lot!) The rich guy decides to cancel both debts. Who's going to like him more? Simon says "That's easy, the one who owes him more". (Luke doesn't actually say that Simon said "That's easy".)

Then Jesus says "You are right." Simon probably feels good about getting it right but the feeling doesn't last long because Jesus turns to the woman and begins to speak about what just happened:

> 'Simon,' he said 'do you see this woman? I came into your house, and you poured no water over my feet, but she has poured out her tears over my feet and wiped them away with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but she has been covering my feet with kisses ever since I came in. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume. For this reason I tell you that her sins, her many sins, have been forgiven her, for which she has shown such great love. It is the man who is forgiven little who shows little love. Then he said to her, 'Your sins are forgiven'. Those who were with him at table began to say to themselves, 'Who is this man, that he even forgives sins?' But he said to the woman, 'Your faith has saved you; go in peace'. [Luke 7.44-50 JB (adapted)]

At this point Simon could have gone two ways. He could have continued with his self righteous attitude and decided that Jesus was not only a fake but someone who had just said something really bad because by pronouncing forgiveness he made himself equal to God. He could have gone another way too, a narrow way that not many take. He could have begun to think that Jesus is the messenger with beautiful feet who Isaiah talked about -- the Messiah. Which way did Simon go, and which way will we go?

Luke, who wrote this down for us, used to travel with Paul (the same Paul who wrote about half of the New Testament). During his travels, which included a visit to Jerusalem, Luke had the opportunity to talk to people about what happened when Jesus was walking and talking in Israel. I have a feeling that this account about the woman and Simon is from one of those two. Maybe Luke met one of them and got the story first hand?

In the end we don't know whether it was the woman, Simon, or someone else that told Luke about what happened at Simon's place. One thing I do know is that this part of Luke's Gospel tells us how to have a good relationship with God. Luke travelled with Paul, and Paul says the same thing. Following a set of rules and thinking that makes us right before God is the wrong way. No, the right way is to believe in the God who forgives and restores people. Living by rules instead of relying on the living God is prone to make us judgmental. It is also liable to make us blind to the things that really matter. Do you remember how Jesus asked Simon whether he could see the woman? It looks like Simon's prejudice made him blind to her. This is one of the dangers of a closed off self righteousness. Another danger is that you become blind to God himself, failing to recognise the Son of God even when he is right there in front of you.

The woman has taken the right way. She has heard the good news. She has encountered Jesus and a miracle has happened in her heart. Jesus, God with us, has forgiven her. Who on earth or in heaven can condemn her now? She walks with dignity knowing that her king sees her, values her, and loves her. As James says, love covers over a multitude of sins.
