	abstract = {The origin and development of the nomina sacra (sacred names written in an abbreviated form) found in early Christian  texts is much debated in scholarly circles and no agreement has been  reached. However the use of the nomina sacra in P.Lond.Lit. 207  may help to resolve some of the questions that surround the puzzle of  their origin. P.Lond.Lit. 207 is a portion of papyrus that has broken  off from a roll (24.5 X 25.7 cm), covering Psalms 11(12):7 to 14(15):4.  The scribe of P.Lond.Lit. 207 has consistently written Kurios in an abbreviated form (nomen sacrum), giving only the first and last letters, and a supralinear bar drawn above the abbreviation. On the other hand, Theos is always written uncontracted. This is quite unusual given that Theos in Christian texts is always written as a nomen sacrum.  Could the reason for this practice in P.Lond.Lit. 207 be found in the  Semitic custom of contracting personal names to the first and last  letter? Is Kurios abbreviated in this Semitic fashion to notify  the reader that the word is being used to translate the personal name  (the Tetragrammaton) of the Hebrew deity?},

	abstract = {The first textbook that systematically links syntax and exegesis of the New Testament—perfect for students of Greek who are "second-year" or at an intermediate level.For seminary students, the goal of studying Greek grammar in the first place is to ultimately get beyond the grammar itself and understand it well enough to use it in the accurate exegesis of biblical texts.Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics—the most up-to-date Greek grammar available—integrates the technical requirements for proper Greek interpretation with the actual interests and needs of Bible students. It explores numerous syntactical categories, some of which have not previously been dealt with in print, and has a number of distinguishing features, including:Exegetically significant illustrations, discussed in depth.Semantic situations—or contexts for simple semantics—are developed and analyzed.Expanded definitions and numerous examples and syntactical categories.Grammatical statistics listed at the beginning of major sections.Scores of charts, tables, and graphs.Sound exegesis requires that the exegete consider grammar within a larger framework that includes context, lexeme, and other linguistic features. This textbook faithfully equips intermediate Greek students with the skills they need to do exegesis of biblical texts in a way that is faithful to their intended meaning.The expanded edition contains a subject index, a Greek word index, and page numbers in the Syntax Summary section.},
