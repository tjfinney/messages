<h2 id="a-deep-impression">A deep impression</h2>

<p>Today&rsquo;s lectionary reading from Mark talks about what happened when Jesus went to church one day. He caused a bit of a stir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They went as far as Capernaum, and as soon as the sabbath came he went to the synagogue and began to teach. And his teaching made a deep impression on them because, unlike the scribes, he taught them with authority.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Mark 1.21-22 Jerusalem Bible]</p>

<p>I like Mark&rsquo;s Gospel. It wasn&rsquo;t terribly popular in the early years of the church. We know that because we can look at the oldest manuscripts (i.e. hand copies) that we still have and see which New Testament books they cover. Looking at the Gospels, copies of Matthew, John, and Luke are found most often, followed by Mark. It seems that the Gospel of Mark was the poor relation. Someone called B. H. Streeter said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark provided very few lessons for the selection read in the public services of the Church. It was much less used and much less commented on than the other Gospels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Streeter, <em>The Four Gospels</em> (1924), 64]</p>

<p>How do we account for this? Maybe it&rsquo;s because Mark&rsquo;s Greek is a bit rough. His Gospel is what you would expect if a fisherman&rsquo;s son wrote down what his dad used to say. It&rsquo;s vivid, it gives a first hand account, it&rsquo;s what you would get if Peter was telling the story and Mark was writing it down. Around 100 AD, someone named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papias_of_Hierapolis">Papias of Hierapolis</a> said this about Mark&rsquo;s Gospel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered&hellip; [H]e accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers]&hellip;. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took special care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0125.htm">Fragments of Papias</a></p>

<p>Reading Mark is just like being there: what happened as it happened. It&rsquo;s as if we have Peter telling the story, but every time he said something like <em>then we went to Capernaum</em>, Mark wrote down <em>then they went to Capernaum.</em></p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s reading from Mark follows straight on from where Jesus begins to proclaim the Good News from God:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The time has come</em> he said <em>and the kingdom of God is close at hand. Repent, and believe the Good News.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Mark 1.14-15 JB]</p>

<p>The next thing Mark tells us is that Jesus called Simon, Andrew, James, and John from their fishing boats, which Toby talked about last week. Jesus said, <em>Follow me and I will make you fishers of people.</em> We know Simon by the name Jesus gave him, which is Peter.</p>

<p>After Jesus said <em>follow me</em>, they went to the synagogue in Capernaum, a town on the shores of Lake Galilee. A synagogue is a Jewish house of worship, just like a church. The funny thing is that <em>synagogue</em> is a Greek word. It means <em>gather together</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Capernaum.jpg" alt="An old synagogue in Capernaum" title="An old synagogue in Capernaum" /></p>

<p>Mark tells us that the people gathered together in that synagogue were astonished by Jesus because he taught with authority, not like the scribes. I wonder what this means? The Greek word translated as <em>authority</em> is ἐξουσία, meaning <em>power</em> or <em>authority</em>. The scribes were probably well educated in the scriptures and used to say what various well respected interpreters had said. However, they lacked something Jesus had. What happens next gives us a clue about this power and authority that Jesus has.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In their synagogue just then there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit, and it shouted, <em>What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Mk 1.23-25 JB]</p>

<p>When I hear about possessed men and unclean spirits I want to turn around and run the other way. This man started shouting in Church! A definite lack of decorum, and to make things even more freaky he shouts out that he knows who the guy up the front is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know who you are, God&rsquo;s Holy One!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were the average person sitting in that synagogue (or getting ready to run out of the synagogue with me) then you would know something about the Holy One of God. That&rsquo;s because the Hebrew scriptures talk about him. Sometimes they call him the Messiah. Moses talks about him like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adonai your God will raise up for you a prophet like myself, from among yourselves, from your own brothers; to him you must listen. This is what you yourselves asked of Adonai your God at Horeb on the day of the Assembly. You said, <em>Do not let me hear again the voice of Adonai my God, nor look any longer on this great fire, or I shall die</em>; and Adonai said to me, <em>All they have spoken is well said. I will raise up a prophet like yourself for them from their own brothers; I will put my words into his mouth and he shall tell them all I command him. The man who does not listen to my words that he speaks in my name shall be held answerable to me for it&hellip;.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Dt 18.15-20 JB (adapted)]</p>

<p>So there is a stand off between Jesus and the possessed man. What happens next? Jesus tells the spirit off. <em>Be quiet! Come out of him!</em> For those who had not yet run out of the synagogue there was now an amazing sight. The unclean spirit threw the man into convulsions and with a loud cry went out of him.</p>

<p>Once they had a chance to collect their wits they started asking each other,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s this? Here&rsquo;s a new teaching with authority behind it: he even gives orders to unclean spirits and they obey him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mark doesn&rsquo;t say anything else about that poor man. Up until Jesus came to town, I imagine that people avoided him like the plague. Now he was calm, he was gentle, he was sane. People no longer need fear him. Jesus had rescued him from slavery to an awful oppressor. The man had been set free by the Great Emancipator.</p>

<p>What do we make of places where the New Testament mentions demon possession and unclean spirits? Something had hold of that man to the point where it owned him. It had control of him. These days we might use words like <em>sick</em>. <em>disturbed</em>, <em>troubled</em>, <em>unstable</em>, or describe the person as having <em>mental problems</em>, <em>anger management issues</em>, <em>a split personality</em>. (Professionals use a different vocabulary.)</p>

<p>Throughout the New Testament there is an awareness of a spirit world, and not everything there is sweetness and light. Some of it is really messed up. Whatever this man had, Jesus had authority over it. He told it off, like you would tell off a bad dog, and off it went.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s think about that man a bit more. He was harassed and tormented. His friends and family had suffered with him. Whether they were still around, no one knows. One thing we do know, few suffer like those who with a tormented soul. Many of us have been touched by this kind of torment, whether in ourselves or someone close. We have seen how destructive it is, what shame it brings, how it makes people run away.</p>

<p>What made the man like this is a mystery. The New Testament seems to associate evil spirits with idolatry. Worshipping the wrong thing can have undesirable side effects. Delving into the unclean can make you unclean. Whatever the cause, the results were plain to see. A disturbed man who suffered torment every day. Every day, that is, until Jesus of Nazareth stepped in.</p>

<p>All kinds of things can cause suffering; psychological torment is just one. People suffer because of terrible things that have happened to them or to people they love. They think about it every day. They ask why this had to happen. They plead for it to go away. They wonder what they could have done to make things turn out differently.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to have excellent theological teachers. One of them, Bob Covington, was a visiting lecturer from Alabama in the USA. I was not very impressed the first time I heard him because he spoke with a stammer and seemed a bit weak. As with many of my first impressions, this one was badly wrong. Here was a man of rare depth. One day he told a little group of us, <em>Suffering will bring your theology undone.</em></p>

<p>He was right. There is nothing like suffering to test everything that you think you know about God. There are degrees of suffering. Some kinds you come through OK but there are other kinds that leave you messed up. Suffering can make you break.</p>

<p>Where is God in all this? How could a good God let this happen? Why did you let this happen to me? Or, even worse, why did you let this happen to my child? Maybe the only answer I ended up with is that words fail when it comes to real suffering. I could talk about how a world where there is freedom must necessarily be a world in which things can go wrong. But that is very little help to the mother who&rsquo;s child died on a crosswalk. Real suffering leaves us speechless.</p>

<p>Suffering will drive people to God. However, we can end up disappointed. We can pray and the thing stays the same or even get worse. Where to from here? You are liable to get some glib answers when you ask around. Maybe you didn&rsquo;t pray hard enough? Maybe there is sin in your life? Maybe you don&rsquo;t have enough faith? Maybe this is God&rsquo;s will?</p>

<p>A boy named Anthony Ashley Cooper was born in London in 1801. His uncle was the fifth Earl of Shaftesbury. This boy&rsquo;s parents were busy with high society and treated him badly. His only friend in the world was a housekeeper named Anna Maria Milles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each evening, before a nursemaid came to hurry him off for bed, Maria would take him on her knee and tell him stories from the Gospels and teach him how to pray. She told him of Calvary and the Empty Tomb and spoke of the Lord Jesus as the risen Redeemer who could be a Friend.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[John Pollock, <em>Shaftesbury: The Reformer</em> (Eastbourne: Kingsway, 2000), 19-20]</p>

<p>Many years later he would tell friends how Maria Milles had <em>led him to seek first the Kingdom of God, and rest not until he had found it.</em></p>

<p>[Pollock, <em>Shaftesbury</em>, 20]</p>

<p>After his uncle died, his father became the sixth Earl of Shaftesbury. When his father died, Anthony Ashley Cooper became Lord Anthony, the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury. After going into parliament he devoted himself to reform. He sought to improve the lot of those with none to help them. He was instrumental in getting children out of mines and chimneys, in mandating reasonable working hours, in prevention of cruelty to animals, and many other great things. He was a bit of an overachiever. Here&rsquo;s a list of organisations of which he was founder or president:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Ragged School Union</li>
<li>National Refuges and Training Ships</li>
<li>Church Pastoral Aid Society</li>
<li>British and Foreign Bible Society</li>
<li>Church&rsquo;s Ministry Among the Jews</li>
<li>Dean Close School</li>
<li>John Groom&rsquo;s Association for the Disabled</li>
<li>London City Mission</li>
<li>Missions to Seamen</li>
<li>Open Air Mission</li>
<li>Protestant Alliance</li>
<li>Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association</li>
<li>Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association</li>
</ul>

<p>And that&rsquo;s not all. Here&rsquo;s a list of organisations of which he was vice-president or patron:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aged Pilgrim&rsquo;s Friend Society</li>
<li>Baptist Missionary Society</li>
<li>Barnado&rsquo;s</li>
<li>Christian Evidence Society</li>
<li>Church Missionary Society</li>
<li>Curates Augmentation Fund</li>
<li>Intercontinental Church Society</li>
<li>Lord&rsquo;s Day Observance Society</li>
<li>National Anti-Vivisection Society</li>
<li>National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</li>
<li>North London Homes for the Blind</li>
<li>Railway Mission</li>
<li>Royal Associaton in Aid of the Deaf and Dumb</li>
<li>Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables</li>
<li>Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</li>
<li>Seamen&rsquo;s Hospital Society</li>
<li>South American Missionary Society</li>
<li>Spurgeon&rsquo;s Homes</li>
<li>Tower Hamlets Mission</li>
<li>United Kingdom Alliance</li>
</ul>

<p>[Pollock, <em>Shaftesbury</em>, 185-6]</p>

<p>These lists are impressive. However we should not overlook that his first efforts were devoted to improving conditions for the mentally ill. You might know what the word <em>Bedlam</em> means but probably don&rsquo;t know that <em>Bedlam</em> was the local name for Bethlehem Hospital in London. It was an asylum. People used to go there on Sunday outings to watch the tormented inmates as they suffered the ministrations of straight jackets, whips, and chains. Shaftesbury&rsquo;s efforts on government committees helped to bring about reforms that improved the lot of those confined to England&rsquo;s madhouses. From there the reforms spread around the world.</p>

<p>Shaftesbury&rsquo;s reforms can also be attributed to the power and authority of Jesus of Nazareth. When Jesus drove out the devil in the synagogue, he made a man instantly well. Jesus spoke, and it happened. Sometimes however the authority of Jesus works in a less immediate way. It works through people who decide to seek the Kingdom of God and rest not until they find it. Jesus is still just as concerned for those who suffer. His power and authority still work to set people free. Sometimes the power acts quickly and sometimes it takes a life time. There are mysteries and unanswered questions, but still his power works.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>
