      <description>In the days of the Judges famine came to the land and a certain man from Bethlehem of Judah went &amp;ndash; he, his wife and his two sons &amp;ndash; to live in the country of Moab.
 [Ruth 1.1 JB]
 Alleluia! Praise the Lord, my soul.
 [Psalm 146.1 JB]
 But now Christ has made his appearance as a high priest bringing benefits that have come about through the greater and more perfect tent which wasn&amp;rsquo;t crafted by human hands, that is, which didn&amp;rsquo;t originate with the created order.</description>

      <title>Why don&#39;t ladies wear hats in church anymore?</title>

      <description>If you are old enough then you will remember a time when a lot of ladies wore hats in church. Nowadays there are still churches where the adult women wear hats; the Cook Island Churches are a good example. However, most churches don&amp;rsquo;t practice this any more. Why is that so?
Why wear hats? The first question is, why did women wear hats in the first place? It&amp;rsquo;s probably to do with something that Paul said:</description>

      <description>Today we are going to abandon the usual lectionary reading (which is from Mark&amp;rsquo;s Gospel) and instead look at Matthew&amp;rsquo;s Gospel. That&amp;rsquo;s because we have been hearing about the bread of heaven over the last few weeks, which inspired me to talk about the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer.
A bit missing? The Lord&amp;rsquo;s Prayer may well be the best known piece of scripture in the Universe, but what does it actually say?</description>

      <description>For Phoebe, who encouraged me to write this down.
And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the LORD your God for the good land which he has given you.
Deuteronomy 8.10
For these and all thy mercies, Lord make us truly thankful.
Thank you for this food, and for the hands that prepared it. Thank you for the people who worked to give us this food. Thank you for the tractors they drove and the farms they ploughed.</description>

      <description>Today is Trinity Sunday, and we will be looking at the part of John&amp;rsquo;s Gospel that talks about one night when a man named Nicodemus went to talk to Jesus. The part is chapter 3, verses 1 to 17, which includes those famous words:
 For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.</description>

      <description>A deep impression Today&amp;rsquo;s lectionary reading from Mark talks about what happened when Jesus went to church one day. He caused a bit of a stir.
 They went as far as Capernaum, and as soon as the sabbath came he went to the synagogue and began to teach. And his teaching made a deep impression on them because, unlike the scribes, he taught them with authority.

      <description>Isaiah 64 Today&amp;rsquo;s reading is from Isaiah chapter 64:
Oh that you would tear the heavens open and come down --at your Presence the mountains would melt, as fire sets brushwood alight, as fire causes water to boil-- to make known your name to your enemies, and make the nations tremble at your Presence, working unexpected miracles such as no one has ever heard of before. No ear has heard, no eye has seen any god act like this for those who trust him.</description>

      <description>Thank you all for being here. Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about the Easter holidays. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about these Easter holidays but about the original Easter holy days, three days that changed everything.
Give us a sign In chapter twelve of Matthew&amp;rsquo;s Gospel we find Jesus in a dispute with the religious authorities. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it happened:
 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the mute man spoke and saw.</description>

      <description>What Christians now call communion or the Last Supper began as a Passover Meal that Jesus shared with his disciples the night before he was crucified. Jesus told his disciples to remember him whenever they had that meal. At a previous service we looked at certain aspects of the bread. Tonight we will look at certain aspects of the wine.
The Passover meal has four cups of wine but we will only have two cups tonight.</description>

      <description>Bread and wine What Christians call communion or the Lord&amp;rsquo;s supper started off as a Passover meal that Jesus ate with his disciples on the night before he went to the cross.
During communion we eat something like bread and drink something like wine. Communion is a symbolic meal, and tonight we will look at the symbolism of the bread. Next month I hope to look at the symbolism of the wine.</description>

      <description>Tonight we will look at something from Luke&amp;rsquo;s Gospel, which tells us about what happened once when Jesus was invited to a meal. Here is how it starts:
 One of the Pharisees invited him to a meal. When he arrived at the Pharisee&amp;rsquo;s house and took his place at table, a woman came in, who had a bad name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and had brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment.</description>

      <description>The ten commandments Our church has been going through the ten commandments and now we have reached the last one. God gave these commandments to the Israelites after he set them free. The commandments tell us how to honour God and respect each other. A country that obeys these commands will be set free, but any nation that ignores them is in danger of reverting to slavery.
The children of Israel had just been set free from Egypt.</description>

      <description>Telling God&amp;rsquo;s story Christians are meant to be evangelists. That means we are meant to tell people the good news. The word evangelist comes from the Greek ευαγγελιον, which means good news. The word gospel also means good news but has German ancestry (as do a lot of English words).1
If you are like me then you have trouble being an evangelist. I find evangelism hard, like going to the dentist.</description>

      <description>Introduction We have been hearing about a well known part of Paul&amp;rsquo;s Letter to the Galatians, where he says:
 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
 Gal 5.22-23
The Galatians were Celts, the same people whose descendants still live in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. What were they doing all the way over in Asia Minor?</description>

      <description>A general letter The First Letter of Peter is one of the seven General Letters in the New Testament: James; First and Second Peter; First, Second, and Third John; and Jude. These letters are called &amp;ldquo;General&amp;rdquo; because they are addressed to general groups of people instead of particular ones. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a general letter:
&amp;ldquo;To Everyone living in Australia, treat foreigners as well as you treat your own people and love them as much as you love yourself.</description>

      <description>Introduction We have been looking at what the Four Gospels say about what happened on Easter Sunday, and this week we are looking at Mark&amp;rsquo;s account.
Mark&amp;rsquo;s Gospel appears to be an eye witness account of Jesus from the time he chose his first followers to when they ran away.
Eusebius, who wrote a history of the church around 300 AD, tells us what someone named Papias wrote about Mark.</description>

      <description>A letter from prison We&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Paul&amp;rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians and today we are up to chapter three. Paul wrote this letter from prison, and he seems to have doubts about getting out alive: To me life means Christ and death means gain Phil 1.21.
Some think he was in prison in Rome, others in Ephesus, and others in Caesarea. I think the Letter fits well with his imprisonment in Caesarea after being arrested in the temple at Jerusalem.</description>

      <description>A favourite The Psalms are one of the best-loved parts of the Bible, and one of the best-loved Psalms is Psalm 23 (XXIII in Roman numerals). &amp;ldquo;Psalm&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;song&amp;rdquo;, so what better way to introduce it than to sing it?
The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want. He makes me down to lie In pastures green; He leadeth me The quiet waters by. My soul He doth restore again; And me to walk doth make Within the paths of righteousness, Even for His own Name’s sake.</description>

      <description>Four Gospels The Four Gospels are four versions of the Good News concerning Jesus Christ. In them the first generation of Christians tell us what they witnessed when Jesus came to town.
We have been handed four Gospels, those according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These are the written accounts of the Good News concerning Jesus Christ handed down to us by the first generation of Christians. They are from the time of the apostles, and can be linked with four early Christian leaders (or the missions they headed): James the Just, first bishop of Jerusalem; Peter, taking the Gospel to Jews beyond the Holy Land; Paul, apostle to the Gentiles (i.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;You stupid Galatians! Who put the evil eye on you?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s what Paul says in his letter to the Galatians. Wikipedia says &amp;ldquo;The Galatians were a Celtic people that dwelt mainly in the north central regions of Asia Minor or Anatolia, in what was known as Galatia, in today&amp;rsquo;s Turkey.&amp;rdquo;1 Back then people who spoke Celtic languages could be found all the way from Scotland in the West to the Roman province of Galatia in the East.</description>

 No one is right, no one. All have gone wrong. Jews and non-Jews alike have a problem &amp;ndash; they do not measure up to their own standards, let alone God&amp;rsquo;s. What can we do about this? Make a big sacrifice? No, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough.</description>

 I baptize by immersing you in water. However, someone who is stronger than I am is coming; I am not worthy even to release the straps on his sandals.</description>

      <description>Much in common Matthew, Mark, and Luke make up the three synoptic Gospels. These three have much in common but have unique elements as well. (Synoptic means “a general view, or a collection of heads or parts so arranged as to exhibit a general view of the whole.”)
Based on this chart1, would you venture to suggest a solution to the synoptic problem?

      <description>Christians keeping secrets This Bible study looks at a few parts of the New Testament which hint that the first Christians were keeping some secrets. The initial trigger for this study was a sentence in the Acts of the Apostles that Karen Jobes pointed out in her commentary on 1 Peter.1 This sentence has been an eye-opener for me, a key to understanding some otherwise puzzling aspects of the New Testament.</description>

      <description>I love Mark&amp;rsquo;s Gospel. An early Christian named Papias said that
 Mark, having been Peter&amp;rsquo;s interpreter, wrote accurately though not in order all that he recalled of what was either said or done by the Lord. For he neither heard the Lord nor was he a follower of his but at a later date of Peter; who used to adapt his instuctions to the needs of the moment but not with a view to putting together the Lord&amp;rsquo;s sayings in orderly fashion: so that Mark did no wrong in thus writing some things as he recalled them.</description>

The subtitle tells us that these three pillars are teaching, practice, and enlightenment.1 Since becoming a Christian I have been studying another book, the New Testament, which began as twenty-seven individual writings that were later collected into four parts:

What do you think it is? It is actually a very old Christian symbol which represents a very good summary of the Gospel.
If you look closely, you might see that these Greek letters are contained in the wheel:
 Ι (iota)
 Χ (chi)
 Θ (theta)
 Υ (upsilon)
 Σ (sigma)

That would be good until the batteries ran out unless you were lucky enough to have a solar-powered battery charger too. In some ways books are a better technology than electronic devices. You can drop them, leave them in the rain, or get sand in them and they still work.</description>

      <description>An honour I am honoured to be able to speak at one of your final assemblies as Manning Uniting Church. I grew up among the people in this church and you played an important part in my upbringing. Despite being disinclined to listen, I heard the oracles of God from an early age. Not that I thought much of them at the time.
Today&amp;rsquo;s message is called “Things I have found out about God,” and there are a number of them so I had better hurry up.</description>

      <description>Introduction  &amp;hellip; on this rock I will build my church. — Jesus Christ [Matt 16.18]
 The church is not a building but a Christian community built on the foundation of faith in Jesus Christ. In other words, it is a community of people who are convinced that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, the Son of the living God. A great deal of Christ&amp;rsquo;s teaching only makes sense in a community context.</description>
