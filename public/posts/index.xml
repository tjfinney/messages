      <description>Introduction We have been looking at what the Four Gospels say about what happened on Easter Sunday, and this week we are looking at Mark&amp;rsquo;s account.
Mark&amp;rsquo;s Gospel appears to be an eye witness account of Jesus from the time he chose his first followers to when they ran away.
Eusebius, who wrote a history of the church around 300 AD, tells us what someone named Papias wrote about Mark.</description>

      <description>Introduction We&amp;rsquo;ve been going through Paul&amp;rsquo;s Letter to the Philippians and today we are up to chapter three. Paul wrote this letter from prison, and he seems to have doubts about getting out alive: To me life means Christ and death means gain Phil 1.21.
Some think he was in prison in Rome, others in Ephesus, and others in Caesarea. I think the Letter fits well with his imprisonment in Caesarea after being arrested in the temple at Jerusalem.</description>
