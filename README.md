This is a collection of messages I've written. The messages are written in Markdown using RStudio, archived on GitHub, and hosted on Netlify.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a new MarkDown doc in `content/posts` (possibly by duplicating an existing one)
2. Run hugo server (`hugo server`)
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) with your browser
4. Edit the doc and see what it looks like in the browser.

To see the result, commit, push to GitHub, then browse to Netlify:

1. `git add *`
2. `git commit -m "foo"`
3. `git push`
4. Browse to [https://tjfinney-messages.netlify.com/](https://tjfinney-messages.netlify.com/).

## References

To get references to work, click "Preview" in RStudio then push to Github.
