This is a collection of messages I've delivered.

The messages are written in Markdown using RStudio.

To get references to work, click "Preview" in RStudio then push to Github.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a new MarkDown doc in `content/posts` (possibly by duplicating an existing one)
2. Run hugo server (`hugo server`)
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) with your browser
4. Edit the doc and see what it looks like in the browser.

Once the doc is finished, commit then push to GitHub:

1. 
2.
